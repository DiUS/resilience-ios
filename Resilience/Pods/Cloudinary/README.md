## Usage

### Configuration

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `cloud_name` parameter set. 
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads, eager sprite generation) must have the `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters set. See [API, URLs and access identifiers](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/api_and_access_identifiers) for more details.

Setting the `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters can be done either directly in each call to a Cloudinary method or by globally setting using the CLOUDINARY_URL variable.

The following example creates a `CLCloudinary` object initializd with a `CLOUDINARY_URL` varaible.   

    #import "Cloudinary/Cloudinary.h"

    CLCloudinary *cloudinary = [[CLCloudinary alloc] initWithUrl: @"cloudinary://123456789012345:abcdeghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12@n07t21i7"];

You can also set any configuration parameter programatically:

    CLCloudinary *cloudinary = [[CLCloudinary alloc] init];
    [cloudinary.config setValue:@"n07t21i7" forKey:@"cloud_name"];
    [cloudinary.config setValue:@"123456789012345" forKey:@"api_key"];
    [cloudinary.config setValue:@"abcdeghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12" forKey:@"api_secret"];


### Embedding and transforming images

Any image uploaded to Cloudinary can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates a URL on an uploaded `sample` image:

    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:@"sample.jpg"];
    
    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/upload/sample.jpg

The following example generates an image URL of an uploaded `sample` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle:

    CLTransformation *transformation = [CLTransformation transformation];
    [transformation setWidthWithInt: 100];
    [transformation setHeightWithInt: 150];
    [transformation setCrop: @"fill"];
    
    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:@"sample.jpg" options:@{@"transformation": transformation}];

    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/upload/c_fill,h_150,w_100/sample.jpg

Another example, embedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail. This time using a dictionary of parameters: 

    CLTransformation *transformation = [CLTransformation transformation];
    [transformation setParams: @{@"width": @90, @"height": @90, @"crop": @"thumb", @"gravity": @"face"}];

    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:@"sample.jpg" options:@{@"transformation": transformation}];
    
    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/upload/c_thumb,g_face,h_90,w_90/sample.jpg

You can provide either a Facebook name or a numeric ID of a Facebook profile or a fan page.  
             
Embedding a Facebook profile to match your graphic design is very simple:
    
    CLTransformation *transformation = [CLTransformation transformation];
    [transformation setWidthWithInt: 90];
    [transformation setHeightWithInt: 130];
    [transformation setCrop: @"fill"];
    [transformation setGravity: @"north_west"];
    
    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:@"billclinton.jpg" options:@{@"transformation": transformation, @"type": @"facebook"}];

    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/facebook/c_fill,g_north_west,h_130,w_90/billclinton.jpg
                           
See [our documentation](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations) for more information about displaying and transforming images.                                         


### Upload

Assuming you have your Cloudinary configuration parameters defined (`cloud_name`, `api_key`, `api_secret`), uploading to Cloudinary is very simple.
    
First you need to implement the `CLUploaderDelegate` protocol for receiving successful and failed upload callbacks as well as upload progress notification. For example:

    #import "ViewController.h"
    #import "Cloudinary/Cloudinary.h"

    @interface ViewController () <CLUploaderDelegate>    
    @end
    
    @implementation ViewController

    ...
    
    - (void) uploaderSuccess:(NSDictionary*)result context:(id)context {
        NSString* publicId = [result valueForKey:@"public_id"];
        NSLog(@"Upload success. Public ID=%@, Full result=%@", publicId, result);
    }
    
    - (void) uploaderError:(NSString*)result code:(int) code context:(id)context {
        NSLog(@"Upload error: %@, %d", result, code);
    }

    - (void) uploaderProgress:(NSInteger)bytesWritten totalBytesWritten:(NSInteger)totalBytesWritten totalBytesExpectedToWrite:(NSInteger)totalBytesExpectedToWrite context:(id)context {
        NSLog(@"Upload progress: %d/%d (+%d)", totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite, bytesWritten);
    }
    
    @end

  
The following example uploads a local PNG to the cloud. The path of the image is given to the upload method. 
    
    CLCloudinary *cloudinary = [[CLCloudinary alloc] initWithUrl: @"cloudinary://123456789012345:abcdeghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12@n07t21i7"];

    CLUploader* uploader = [[CLUploader alloc] init:cloudinary delegate:self];
    NSString *imageFilePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"logo" ofType:@"png"];
    
    [uploader upload:imageFilePath options:@{}];
        
Here is a sample log printing of the result dictionary received by the `uploaderSuccess` callback:

    {
        format = png;
        height = 51;
        "public_id" = nmnbdil0cjbuxjmxmzgt;
        "resource_type" = image;
        "secure_url" = "https://.../n07t21i7/image/upload/v1351796439/nmnbdil0cjbuxjmxmzgt.png";
        signature = 3a09d19f85ea029d7862fe1f58ff3a25164c6270;
        url = "http://.../n07t21i7/image/upload/v1351796439/nmnbdil0cjbuxjmxmzgt.png";
        version = 1351796439;
        width = 241;
    }

The uploaded image is assigned a randomly generated public ID. The image is immediately available for download through a CDN:

    [cloudinary url:@"nmnbdil0cjbuxjmxmzgt.png"]
        
    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/upload/nmnbdil0cjbuxjmxmzgt.png
        
You can also specify your own public ID. In the following example the actual data of the image is given to the upload method:    

    NSData *imageData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:imageFilePath];
    [uploader upload:imageData options:@{"public_id": @"ios_image_1"}];

The following example uploads an image based on a given remote URL:

    [uploader upload:@"http://cloudinary.com/images/logo.png" options:@{}];

Instead of implementing the `CLUploaderDelegate` you can provide block parameters for receiving uploading progress and completion events. The following example uploaded a local image while providing `withCompletion` & `andProgress` blocks:

    [uploader upload:imageFilePath options:@{} withCompletion:^(NSDictionary *successResult, NSString *errorResult, NSInteger code, id context) {
        if (successResult) {
            NSString* publicId = [successResult valueForKey:@"public_id"];
            NSLog(@"Block upload success. Public ID=%@, Full result=%@", publicId, successResult);
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Block upload error: %@, %d", errorResult, code);
            
        }
    } andProgress:^(NSInteger bytesWritten, NSInteger totalBytesWritten, NSInteger totalBytesExpectedToWrite, id context) {
        NSLog(@"Block upload progress: %d/%d (+%d)", totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite, bytesWritten);        
    }];

*Note: A dedicated `CLUploader` instance must be used for each file uploading. 

Synchronous upload is supported and is required for using the upload API from within an NSOperation. Simply set the `sync` option to @YES.
    
    [uploader upload:imageFilePath options:@{"sync": @YES}];
        
See [our documentation](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images) for plenty more options of direct uploading to the cloud. 

### Safe mobile uploading  

iOS applications might prefer to avoid keeping the sensitive `api_secret` on the mobile device. It is recommended to generate the upload authentication signature on the server side. 
This way the `api_secret` is stored only on the much safer server-side. 

Cloudinary's iOS SDK allows providing server-generated signature and any additional parameters that were generated on the server side (instead of signing using `api_secret` locally).

The following example intializes CLCloudinary without any authentication parameters:

    CLCloudinary *mobileCloudinary = [[CLCloudinary alloc] init];

    [mobileCloudinary.config setValue:@"n07t21i7" forKey:@"cloud_name"];

Your server can use any Cloudinary libraries (Ruby on Rails, PHP, Python & Django, Java, Perl, .Net, etc.) for generating the signature. The following JSON in an example of a response of an upload authorization request to your server:  

    { 
      "signature": "sgjfdoigfjdgfdogidf9g87df98gfdb8f7d6gfdg7gfd8",
      "public_id": "abdbasdasda76asd7sa789",
      "timestamp": 1346925631,
      "api_key": "123456789012345",
      "cloud_name": "n07t21i7"
    }

The following code uploads an image to Cloudinary with the parameters generated safely on the server side (e.g., from a JSON as in the example above):

    CLUploader* mobileUploader = [[CLUploader alloc] init:mobileCloudinary delegate:self];
    [mobileUploader upload:imageData options:@{@"public_id": public_id, @"signature": signature, 
        @"timestamp": timestamp, @"api_key": api_key, @"cloud_name": cloud_name}];

You might want to reference uploaded Cloudinary images and raw files using an identifier string of the following format:

    resource_type:type:identifier.format
    
The following example generates a Cloudinary URL based on an idenfier of the format mentioned above:      
  
    NSString *imageIdentifier = @"image:upload:dfhjghjkdisudgfds7iyf.jpg";
    NSArray *components = [imageIdentifier componentsSeparatedByString:@":"];
    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:[components objectAtIndex:2] options:@{@"type": [components objectAtIndex:1], 
                                                                  @"resource_type": [components objectAtIndex:0]}];

    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/image/upload/dfhjghjkdisudgfds7iyf.jpg

Same can work for raw file uploads:    
  
    NSString *rawIdentifier = @"raw:upload:cguysfdsfuydsfyuds31.doc";
    NSArray *components = [rawIdentifier componentsSeparatedByString:@":"];
    NSString *url = [cloudinary url:[components objectAtIndex:2] options:@{@"type": [components objectAtIndex:1], 
                                                                  @"resource_type": [components objectAtIndex:0]}];
    
    // http://res.cloudinary.com/n07t21i7/raw/upload/cguysfdsfuydsfyuds31.doc
